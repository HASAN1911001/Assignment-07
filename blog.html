                    The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include: <br>
                    * Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body. <br>
                    * Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared. <br>
                    * Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block. <br>

                    An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. Let's see the differences below: <br>

                    * Syntax <br>
                    * Arguments binding <br>
                    * Use of this keyword <br>
                    * Using a new keyword <br>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="bg-light" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#Q3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="Q3">
            Why you consider using templete string?

                    Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate 
                    like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and 
                    contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags
                    are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are
                    great for converting strings to different entities.
